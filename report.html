                            <h4>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of
                                structure did you choose to implement?</h4>
                            <p>My website is a lifestyle blog containing news for anyone interested in the
                                alternative/goth
                                subculture. I created this website because while I found many websites online either
                                about
                                horror and fantasy books and movies, or about metal music, there weren’t that many
                                websites
                                that would link together a diverse range of interests that a large proportion of people
                                in
                                this subculture find interesting. The aim of the site is to collect information about
                                different cultural areas that are interesting to a lot of people who belong to this
                                subculture: e.g. there are separate pages displaying horror and dark fantasy book
                                reviews,
                                horror movie reviews, unusual and spooky travel locations, and upcoming goth/music
                                events.
                                The structure is modelled on a typical review/news website where there are separate
                                ‘listings’ pages for the different areas of culture such as movies, books or travel.
                                These
                                pages display a list of review titles together with clickable images; for instance, with
                                book covers for the Book Reviews pages. Clicking on these images directs you to an
                                article/review page. Some of the reviews pages and articles also contain and aside bar
                                where
                                there are links to external resources about popular gothic books, movies, or holidays.
                                There
                                is also a form page where you can subscribe to a newsletter.

                            <h4>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
                                guest speakers, other
                                websites, artists, developers etc.</h4>
                            <p>
                                1. I was inspired by the website for Pacific Northwest Stories. This is a website for a
                                group of horror and dark
                                fantasy podcasts made by the Canadian artist Terry Miles. While this website is made
                                with Squarespace, which
                                contains ready-made templates for websites, I like the appearance and layout for the
                                website and drew upon some
                                of
                                the styling ideas I found effective in it, such as the use of a dark forest background
                                for the header, high
                                contrast
                                settings that make for ease of readability, and a clear division of each page into a
                                large header, main area
                                (with
                                icons for the podcast listings) and footer. I also really liked how the color palette of
                                blacks, greys and
                                mauves
                                reflects the mysterious and atmospheric content of the art that the website is
                                promoting. However, the one thing
                                I
                                decided I would change is that the images for the icons of the podcasts on the ‘Our
                                Shows’ page on this website
                                take
                                forever to load, which is really off-putting for the user. As such, I made a note to use
                                smaller icons for the
                                books
                                and movies listings in my website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. Additionally, I was motivated to make this website because I have been attending an
                                online horror book club
                                for
                                the last couple of years whichs also organizes movie events in person and in real life;
                                I found the club on
                                Meetup.com. I have noticed that many of the members of the book club have similar
                                interests when it comes to not
                                only books, but films, and music as well, and that having a website combining
                                suggestions of these different
                                forms
                                of entertainment media in the goth/horror genre would be something that a lot of members
                                would enjoy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. Finally, one of my inspirations was the book review website called <a
                                    href="www.lithub.com"></a>Literary
                                Hub</a> What I like
                                about this website in particular is the listing of new novels or poetry books on this
                                page:
                                <a href="https://lithub.com/category/fictionandpoetry/">Lithub</a> . There are clickable
                                images of book covers
                                in a grid layout that
                                looks clean and is easy to navigate. Clicking on a cover takes you to more information
                                about that book. I liked
                                how
                                there is not too much information on this page, making it very user friendly: there is
                                no lengthy description
                                underneath the book icons, just the image and the title, which makes it relaxing to
                                scroll through these looking
                                for
                                suggestions. I have also often used this site on my mobile phone as well as on a desktop
                                computer, and I have
                                found
                                that the images get resized and placed into one column instead of three on smaller
                                screens, and this responsive
                                layout makes this a favourite website of mine to scroll through on different devices.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <section class="hidden review-article-section" id="review-section-3">
                            <h4>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h4>
                            <p>
                                1. The most simple way I knew I had to make my site accessible was by including ‘alt’
                                HTML tags to images, labels to input fields, and aria-labels on non-text HTML elements.
                                For example, I used an aria-label on the dropdown menu button with three bars on it,
                                which I made using three lines as CSS divs, as this button did not have any text inside
                                the HTML element (unlike the Load More button, which says ‘Load More…’). Therefore, a
                                disabled user using a screenreader would not be able to know what it looks out if the
                                screenreader was reading out the HTML, thus highlighting the importance of adding an
                                aria-label.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. The second way I made my site accessible to users is by implementing a Dark Mode
                                toggle button. I personally know many people with light sensitivities chronic migraines,
                                who dislike looking at bright lights and prefer reading with a dark mode. There is a
                                Dark Mode button on the top-left of every page in the website, so the user does not have
                                to search for this option in a settings menu, as it is positioned in a way to make it
                                easily accessible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. Finally, I implemented different text-size options in a span of buttons for large
                                text, medium text, small text and extra-small text, for users with visual difficulties
                                reading small text. On the click of one of these buttons, the text of the whole page is
                                enlarged. I did this by setting the ‘root’ font-size of the HTML document to a certain
                                number in pixels, and then setting the font-size of all the other text elements in rem
                                units, so that it is easily resized when the absolute root font-size changes.
                            </p>
                        </section>
                        <section class="hidden review-article-section" id="review-section-4">
                            <h4>
                                State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                1. I have tried to select colors for both the dark and the light modes on the site that
                                have a high contrast
                                ratio, so mainly black background with white text, and white background with black text.
                                I also used red to
                                change text color when hovering on important links or buttons, as this color is the
                                brightest non-monochromatic
                                color that will contrast with both black and white. For larger screens, I set the black
                                and the white color to
                                be slightly off from #000000 for black and #FFFFFF for white, as the contrast between
                                pure black and pure white
                                could seem too harsh on a large screen. However, when the screen size is reduced to a
                                mobile-sized screen, I
                                reset the root black and white variables to pure #000000 black and pure #FFFFFF white,
                                as people are more likely
                                to use a mobile screen outside in the sunlight, and therefore a higher contrast would be
                                advantageous to the
                                visibility in these settings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. I have tried to follow conventions frequently used in websites, such as placing the
                                SPOOKTASTIC logo on the
                                top left of the site, and the contact and copyright/date information in the footer, as
                                these are the places
                                users usually look for this data. I know from my own experience that when I want to
                                reference an online
                                resource, I always scroll to the end of the page as this is where I expect to find the
                                date, and understand the
                                frustration when this is in the centre of the HTML or somewhere else.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. An important way in which I tried to make my website user-friendly was by creating a
                                simple navigation
                                structure. By this, I mean that for every page in the website, there need not be more
                                than 2 clicks to take the
                                user to any other page. For example, if I am on the page for the travel review of
                                Washington State, USA, to get
                                to a Book Review, I need to navigate once to go to the Book Reviews page, and once more
                                to click on the selected
                                book review. I think that having too many clicks to get between pages on the website
                                makes for an exhausting
                                user experience, which is why I tried to eliminate this problem.
                            </p>

                        <section class="hidden review-article-section" id="review-section-5">
                            <h4>
                                State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and
                                describe how you did that
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                1. I had to work out how to store a setting on the website, so that it was applied to
                                the whole style when the user navigated through the different pages. This was necessary
                                for setting the text size and the Dark Mode, as I didn’t want the user to have to select
                                the right option every time they went to a new page. I read about using the localStorage
                                JS property to do this on here:
                                https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/ I then had to create
                                some functions to adapt this feature to storing the right data to keep the preferred
                                text-size stored in the user’s browser, and decide to create a localStorage variable
                                called ‘textSize’ and a string with ‘22px’ or ‘14px’ stored in it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. I had to create a Subscribe to Our Newsletter form, and
                                I wanted to make sure it would be responsive. However, I had a problem getting the label
                                for the text inputs to be ‘inline’ with the input boxes, so I set a responsive grid
                                layout on the container for each label and input, which I had to play around with before
                                it worked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. The most challenging thing I had to do was create an image gallery inside the
                                articles I wrote. I wanted to increase and decrease the image size of the images in the
                                gallery when the text size was changed, as the tiny images together with a large text
                                size might reduce the user’s attention, as there could seem to be too much text and too
                                few images splitting it up. Therefore, I made a global variable in globals.js
                                to store the properties (the sizes for each text-size) of the images in the responsive
                                gallery for each screen size, and then call a function that would change these sizes

                                another time?

                                My main issue is that I couldn’t manage to get the aside menus to look like the links
                                were evenly spread out with the header. I wish I had spent more time on the asides as I
                                always find it so difficult to get them to be aligned neatly with the rest of the text.
                                I spent a lot of time adjusting lots of CSS properties, so that the long aside on the
                                right of the article on large screens wouldn’t look ridiculous. I also had this problem
                                during the midterm, so I worked more on it, but still need to research more about how to
                                make the aside element look good.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also have a problem with the fact that when the user clicks to load/hide the reviews,
                                or the article sections, the expansion and contraction of the content looks clunky and
                                makes the user lose their position on the page. I would like to implement some functions
                                that would enable the page to scroll up or down slowly when these buttons are clicked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also tried to integrate an automated slideshow with a user-controlled slideshow in the
                                Seed Review HTML page, in order to adapt the slideshow code I found on the W3 schools
                                tutorial, but somehow whenever I tried to mix these two features nothing worked. The
                                slideshow was a bit of a last moment decision, so if I’d had more time, I definitely
                                would have worked more on giving the slideshow both these features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, I wish that I had spent more time integrating video and audio into some
                                pages about music and events, for example having an audio player that the user could
                                control to listen to a particular song for a band being written about.

                                    changed
                                    the copied CSS to reduce the padding on the sticky header, as it was covering too
                                    much of
                                    the screen, and giving it a z-index to make it appear on top of other elements. I
                                    then had
                                    to increase the z-index of the navbar links and logo appearing on the sticky header,
                                    otherwise they were hidden behind it when the user scrolled down. Again, instead of
                                    using an
                                    inline function I added a ‘scroll’ event listener in the script file to the entire

                                    object and a conditional statement to only show the sticky header for screens over

                                    I used the following tutorials to learn how to make a tribar mobile menu icon that
                                    opens and
                                    closes a dropdown menu when click. Obviously, I changed the color and the size of
                                    the tribar
                                    to make it fit into the aesthetic of my own site. For the tutorials from W3 schools,
                                    I also
                                    changed any inline event handlers by putting them as event listeners in the script.
                                    I also
                                    made the site conform to a responsive layout by hiding the menu-button on larger
                                    screens,
                                    and showing it (instead of the navbar menu links on the top-right corner of the
                                    page) on
                                    tablet and mobile screens. Furthermore, I found that the angles used to rotate/fade
                                    the
                                    three bars into a cross when the dropdown menu opens in the W3 schools tutorial made
                                    the
                                    cross look quite lopsided on the screen, so I had to fiddle with experimenting with
                                    different angles and translations in the CSS ‘.changeIcon’ animation, more
                                    specifically to
                                    rotate the bars by 43 degrees instead of 45 and to translate them by different
                                    numbers until
                                    I found a specific number to 1 d.p. that gave a more balanced appearance.

                                    I wanted to create a responsive image gallery with a caption below each image. This
                                    code let
                                    me position the div as a caption underneath the image, however, I changed the code
                                    by making
                                    this caption div appear with a black translucent background and white text over the
                                    image
                                    itself for better contrast. I also used the CSS opacity tutorial to make the image
                                    translucent until the user hovers over it. Instead of using floats, I used a grid
                                    layout
                                    that was responsive based on the screen size when it came to the number of images
                                    displayed
                                    in a single row instead of the positioning used in the CSS code that I copied.

                                    On my article pages, I created the possibility to expand the image when the user
                                    clicks on
                                    it by using this code. However, I didn’t use the float position properties like in
                                    the
                                    original CSS, but made the image container fixed when the user clicks on the image
                                    and the
                                    image in the container have an absolute position property. Furthermore, I didn’t use
                                    an exit
                                    button with an ‘X’ like in the CSS but I created a div at the bottom of the larger
                                    image
                                    telling the user to click again to close the image and revert back to the normal
                                    page. I
                                    also made the image caption div positioned over the image disappear when the image
                                    was
                                    expanded.

                                    I used the W3 schools lessons to learn about how to create labels and input fields,
                                    but I
                                    changed the layout of the responsive form by using grid instead of float because I
                                    find that
                                    it’s easier to control and make the resizing more precise. However, also didn’t
                                    display text
                                    when a checkbox was checked, but made it bold instead. Also, I implemented most of
                                    the
                                    JavaScript validation functionality and thank you/error messages myself.
