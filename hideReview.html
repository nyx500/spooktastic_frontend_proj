                            Kiersten White’s first novel is a portrayal of the quintessential millennial experience
                            masquerading as survival horror. White interweaves Greek mythology with 21st century
                            consumerist culture to produce a fast-paced thriller with a pointed political message - due
                            to their obsession with legacy and inheritance, previous generations have created a new form
                            of oligarchy that has destroyed any semblance of freedom and opportunity in modern society.
                            A system that requires the constant sacrifice of the aspirations (‘aspiring’ is used often
                            to describe the characters in the novel) of the majority of the population, in order to
                            maintain the security and comfort of the select few who have been fortunate enough to
                            inherit wealth, power and connections.

                            Our heroine has been hiding all her life, ever since her father brutally murdered her whole
                            family, sparing her only because she remained hidden in what was a gruesome game of
                            hide-and-seek. Mackenzie Black has told herself that hiding is her only talent. All she
                            wants to do is to find a flat in a dead-end town and to earn enough money to get by so that
                            she can remain hidden forever. A solution to her perpetual homelessness appears in the form
                            of a repetition of that gruesome childhood game – an opportunity to participate in a
                            hide-and-seek competition, set in an abandoned amusement park, where 14 contestants have to
                            enter the park through a mysterious gate every day from dawn until dusk. The only rule:
                            ‘don’t be found’. The prize: $50, 000. At first, it is not apparent who has been tasked with
                            finding the contestants – a revelation which is deliciously drawn out by White for most of

                            The fourteen contestants initially seem like caricatures of certain millennial ‘types’, an
                            array of creative, ambitious but undirected individuals whom society has failed. Among them
                            we have ‘beautiful Ava’, an ‘aspiring Instagram model’, who ‘has no sponsors’, and Jaden, an
                            ‘aspiring CrossFit gym owner’ who ‘has no gym’. Sydney is a YouTube with an unsuccessful
                            prank show, and Christian is a, yep you guessed it, aspiring app developer – regardless of
                            the fact that he has no idea as to which app he would like to develop. Logan is full of hope
                            and aspiration for a better life, but with no idea or guidance in which direction he should
                            go. Isabella, perhaps the most pathetic of all the characters, is classified as the eternal
                            intern – she wants to meet the competition’s organizers to ‘network’ and dons a pinstriped
                            pantsuit at every occasion. Ava, an injured veteran, and LeGrand, banished from his father’s
                            Christian cult, are portrayed as the most sympathetic characters in the novel, and are also
                            the ones pursuing the least attention-seeking, self-indulgent goals. Despite this somewhat
                            large cast, White drops casual hints every now and again to remind the reader who is who,
                            and eventually fills in the details of everyone’s backstory, which paints an expressive
                            portrait of each individual that goes beyond the basic outline. The organizer of the
                            hide-and-seek game is an older woman called Linda, whose behaviour creates a creeping sense
                            of foreboding, to say the least. We receive hints from the very beginning that being ‘found’
                            is going to be much, much worse than just missing out on the cash prize – the masseuse
                            treating the contestants before they enter the game is ‘crying’ as she does it, but none of
                            them see her face.

                            'Hide' is an acutely perceptive satire of 21st century American capitalist society. Gary,
                            the
                            chef working for Linda, taunts Rebecca, an actress with nut allergies participating in the
                            competition: “Hey-oh, look at this crew! Let me guess: You want gluten-free options. How
                            about a cruelty-free, free-range piece of avocado toast? The avocados were raised in a
                            hippie commune and sung to sleep every night, and they were never allowed to be friends with
                            a single piece of gluten.”

                            White's thriller makes fun of the glib generalization often made by Boomers that every millennial is a
                            sensitive “snowflake” because they all wrongly believe they’re so special – the chef asks
                            the actress, Rebecca, if she thinks she has ‘special bowels’ because of her food allergies.
                            As such, White creates a parody of the typical Boomer parodying what they see as the spoiled
                            self-indulgence of the millennial generation, thus defusing its ability to oppress and
                            humiliate. After all, whose fault is it that people like Rosiee, who wants to design silver
                            jewellery, or Rebecca, the aspiring actress, were told they could be anything, achieve
                            anything they wanted as long as it made them happy and fulfilled, but never told them what
                            they should be doing?

                            The setting and the imagery used throughout the book also tie into the history of the
                            American dream and the various phases of its evolution during the 20th century – in the
                            1940s, the founders of the park where the contest takes place sacrificed themselves to the
                            monster dwelling within the park’s bounds to create a better society for their children,
                            just like the Silent Generation did during the war and the years following it. Following
                            this grim beginning, during the heyday of Western optimism and increased social mobility in
                            the 1960s and ‘70s, the park becomes an amusement park, highlighting the pivotal role of fun
                            and entertainment during this “Golden Age” of the American Dream. After the park closes due
                            to a tragic incident, construction workers are brought in every few years to work on the
                            pretext of renovation for the “park’s re-opening”, paralleling the disillusionment in
                            progressive social change in American in the 1980s and the shift to practical Reagan and
                            Thatcherite economics.

                            In 2002, the shady Keepers of the park begin organizing the Hide-and-Seek Game, staging it
                            as a reality show – mirroring the new format of the circus for ‘the people’ in the new
                            millennium. In each era, the way in which the monster at the heart of the park is fed
                            becomes a distilled expression for how American capitalism works.

                            The founders of the park are proud of having come up with a system that guarantees harmony,
                            wealth and abundance for their progeny – a few expendable individuals are sacrificed in the
                            park every 7 years to an abominable and invisible Monster (a mutation of the Minotaur of
                            antiquity) in exchange for luck and prosperity for the majority. The park’s founders who run
                            the deadly game of hide-and-seek are proud of how they have contributed to the ‘greater good
                            of society’ with such a low cost – their direct descendants run powerful and influential
                            pharmaceutical and tech companies that contribute to the health of the economy, thus
                            benefitting society as a whole. This is a blatantly barbed jibe at the beating heart of
                            neoliberal and libertarian discourse, exposing the paradox of the ‘trolley problem’ which
                            lies at the bottom of the distorted utilitarianism underlying the worldview of major
                            economic decision-makers. Who today hasn’t heard neoliberal men in power making arrogant
                            assertions about the privatization of health, culture, education and nature because it is
                            good for the economy? This abstraction of a greedy economy that demands the sacrifice of the
                            Hopeful and the Aspirational is akin to the Monster at the center of the amusement park that
                            needs to be fed every 7 years. The health of the capitalist economy requires the sacrifice
                            of the health of the unworthy. The Monster in this novel is named after the famous Minotaur
                            in Greek mythology, Asterion – meaning star or starry. When the Monster opens its slobbering
                            jaws to consume its victims, they see that it doesn’t have teeth – rather, its mouth opens
                            onto a black, yawning abyss which appears to be populated by stars. When reading this, I
                            couldn’t help but think of the truism so commonly cited in civilized, capitalist society:
                            per ardua at astra, through adversity to the stars; a fitting motto for the cult of the
                            American dream. However, the only stars that the contestants reach are those of death and
                            oblivion, rather than of fulfilled aspiration.

                            Despite this biting social commentary, Hide is not in any sense weighed down by the dogmatic
                            and cloying ‘wokeness’ of current attempts at social justice. Kiersten White uses humour and
                            parody frequently to defuse any risk of heavy-handed moralizing: Atrius, a graffiti artist
                            who ‘wants to be the next Banksy’ has misspelled his pseudonym (it was supposed to be
                            Atreus, the name of a Greek god), making it equivalent to the name of a well-known American
                            health-insurance company. In an attempt to save face, Atrius parries, ‘I couldn’t afford
                            health insurance, so I decided to become insurance’. Ava, the disabled veteran, is a lesbian
                            and a woman of color, but she is not presented as a saintlike caricature but as a fully
                            developed individual. LeGrand, a Christian fundamentalist exiled from his father’s sect, is
                            not demonized for being an essentially evil, demonic figure of the white Patriarchy – the
                            misogynistic and homophobic views imparted by his religious background are explored when the
                            author delves into his thought process, but he is not reduced to them.

                            The main weakness of this novel would be the occasional sense of mawkish sentimentalism that
                            descends whenever the narrative veers towards LeGrand’s main motive – to save his gravely
                            ill, disabled younger sister, or Mack’s guilt about her sister dying instead of her.
                            Regrettably, White falls into the trap of extensively detailing the clichéd “I should be
                            dead instead of her” guilt-syndrome of the survivor that lacks sufficient psychological
                            insight and finesse, making this part of the character development seem tropey and
                            unrealistic. I suspect most readers would see the machinations of the Amazement Park’s
                            organizer, Linda, as sufficiently morally abhorrent without making the victims of her
                            cruelty essentially good and self-sacrificing. Nonetheless, apart from this exception, the
                            other descriptions of the characters’ emotions are competent and written well-enough, only
                            occasionally slipping into generics or cliché.

                            Even if you are indifferent to the plight of the millennial generation in a
                            zero-hour-contract gig economy, this book has enough tension and suspense in it to make it a
                            decent thriller overall – White is a master at describing gruesome sounds rather than
                            sights, which makes it all the creepier. Her use of adjectives such as wet and gurgling to
                            describe the sounds of monsters or people dying adds a markedly visceral element to the
                            reading experience. The Monster, invisible most of the time, is described using onomatopoeia
                            and carefully-selected words in a way that the reader can really hear it padding about,
                            hunting its prey. You know that things are going to end very, very badly for the characters
                            who are ‘found’ – but this doesn’t reduce the thrill of waiting for them to be hunted.
