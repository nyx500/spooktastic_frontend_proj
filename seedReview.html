                            This is a story with no redemption. This is a story where the bad guy wins. This is a story
                            where no matter what you do or how hard you try, fate (or genetics) is impossible to outrun.
                            Seed can be read as soul-crushing parallel to incompatibilist determinism in the
                            philosophical sense (in a nutshell, in modern philosophy, incompatibilism means that a
                            belief in determinism is mutually exclusive to any sense of free will an individual might
                            possess).

                            Jack seems like an ordinary guy from a poor background, struggling to get by in a suburban
                            backwater in the deep south of the US. As someone who strongly believes that there should be
                            more horror novels set in hot, humid, tropical environments and is weirdly fascinated by
                            anything set in New Orleans/Louisiana/Florida in general (all that luscious hanging moss!) I
                            absolutely loved the landscape and the setting here. The descriptions of run-down suburbia,
                            as some reviews have already commented, is reminiscent of early Stephen King (think Salem’s
                            Lot, IT, etc.). However, it’s a pale shadow of what can be (tongue-in-cheek) said to be the
                            Platonic ideal of King’s acute observations of the rhythm and beat of the quotidian in
                            small-town America.

                            Jack and his wife Aimee have two kids, Charlie and Abby. Despite their financial problems,
                            we get the impression that before the events in the book start rolling, they have a steady
                            and comfortable family life, the kind that the majority of people aspire to. This is despite
                            the main chasm between Aimee and Jack that roars open as the plot progresses: Jack is
                            balancing his low-paid, dull job with his passion for music. Aimee resents his commitment to
                            his band, particularly when he goes to play gigs in different towns and is away for the
                            weekend. The novel is partly a homage to Rosemary’s Baby too – Aimee’s isolation when her
                            child becomes possessed by a demon and Jack’s consistent refusal to address this reality is
                            one of the most disturbing aspects of the book.

                            It all goes wrong with a car crash. Jack veers off the road and hits a tree because, while
                            driving home, he comes face to face with a set of demonic, glaring eyes. After the accident,
                            his favourite, younger daughter Charlie begins acting peculiar: there are scenes of
                            projectile vomiting (a reference to The Exorcist) and sadistically taunting her mother and
                            her older sister, Abby. For the majority of the plot, Jack and Aimee try to pretend that
                            nothing is wrong. Jack’s denial continues even when he is certain that Charlie is possessed
                            by the same demon that haunted him during his childhood in rural Georgia – a demon whom he
                            ran away from to try to establish a wholesome, ordinary life. He puts down Aimee’s attempts
                            to find the answer to the problem and gaslights her worries, never confessing the truth
                            until the novel reaches its painful denouement. There are attempts to seek religious and
                            psychiatric help, all of which fall flat and lead to nothing but frustration. Jack’s refusal
                            to tell Aimee what he thinks is really happening becomes extremely irritating as the novel
                            goes on. It is ambiguous whether it is the demon restraining him from telling the truth, or
                            whether he truly believes he can solve the problem all on his own. The complete and utter
                            breakdown in communication between the couple is especially haunting – a nod to the kind of
                            alienation which often occurs in a marriage following some kind of trauma or loss.

                            As the demon controls Charlie more and more, we as readers discover more about Jack’s past
                            and the origin of this infernal malaise. The novel clearly exemplifies the concept that no
                            matter how far you run, you cannot outrun your past – or genetics. Jack’s attempts to flee
                            his demonic and tragic past prove to be an exercise in futility. You can escape for some
                            time, but sooner or later, the past will catch up to you. By showing how any kind of
                            religious, moral, or medical attempt to explain the changes in Charlie’s personality are
                            completely useless, Ahlborn seems to want to convey a sense of absolute evil that is
                            irreducible to any kind of acceptable, everyday explanation – whether through the dictates
                            of conventional religion or science. This raises the question of whether there is such an
                            evil, inexplainable by either medicine or traditional, small-town morality – a question
                            which Stephen King has apparently contemplated for most of his life. Is evil a result of the
                            observable and empirical, factors such as upbringing, chemical misfiring in the brain or
                            trauma, or is it something essential and valid in itself? Either way, the harrowing ending
                            of Seed confirms that there are some things that have no way out, no solution, that the past
                            is impossible to break free form, therefore echoing Nietsche’s concept of eternal
                            repetition.

                            Perhaps not an uplifting message, but one that may be topically astute: despite the utopias
                            of the 1960s and 1970s and the cultural drills against exclusionary political rhetoric, the
                            ghost of identitarian dogmatism seems to have been impossible to exorcise from the
                            occidental world. Following the events of the past ten years, history is neither at its end
                            as Francis Fukuyama proclaimed, nor is it a linear progress towards greater freedom and
                            individual rights as the positivists of the 19th century believed. It is a vicious cycle, a
                            snake biting its own tail, and an eternity of repetition. It is a periodic sine wave where
                            totalitarian and communitarian destruction alternates with periods of illusory individualism
                            and freedom. The inexplicable instinct to murder and to maim keeps rearing its ugly head
                            despite any kind of attempt to start afresh, despite the lessons of the brutality of the
                            1930s and ‘40s. Although Seed doesn’t have any redemptive or positive message, it is
                            testament to the air of hopelessness in modern Western society that nothing (despite the
                            optimism of the late 20th century) has changed at all. And the cause of this cyclic
                            repetition? Like Jack’s refusal to acknowledge the truth of what is happening to his wife,
                            it is clearly the lack of will to communicate, to confess, to address the shadow of sadistic
                            exclusionary impulses that can possess us all.
